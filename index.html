            <h2>Our Projects</h2>
            <p>We have completed 3 projects since 2x2 Pixel Team was founded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How hardware works</strong> : <em>Experimenting with Logic Gates</em></li>
                <li><strong>How software works</strong> : <em>Organizing Hour of Code event</em></li>
                <li><strong>How websites work</strong>  : <em>Developing our team website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript</em></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="hw01">
            <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
            <p>Our first project was to build logic gates such as AND, OR, NOR, NOT, NAND, XOR. That project served as an introduction to learn how hardware works.</p> 
        </section>

        <section id="hw02">
            <h2>Hour of Code event</h2>
            <p>The second project was organizing Hour of Code event. Our aim was to introduce basics of coding to children. In order to achieve that goal, we chose to tutor <u>Classic Maze puzzle</u>. The reason behind our decision was the tasks being simple enough for children to understand, and the inclusion of characters from popular games and animation films.</p>
            <p>We are proud to say that we have achieved our goal. Participants were excited to solve the taks and learn something new. Furthermore, some of them even asked us where they could find more puzzles to solve!</p>
        </section>

        <section id="hw03">
            <h2>Our Team Website</h2>
            <p>What you are looking at is our 3rd project =)</p>
            <p>This website is designed to be our official team website where we will document our projects! For now, we mainly focused on Hour of Code event.</p>
            <p>Creating our team website was a great opportunity to improve our web developing skills. We hope that documenting our projects using this website will evoke enthusiasm and encourage others to learn how to code.</p>

            <h2>Vision of 2x2 Pixel Team</h2>
            <p>Our vision is to build a better future by encouraging people to learn how to code, because we believe that anyone can code. Let's work together for better future!</p>
